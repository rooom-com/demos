# rooom Demos

A collection of rooom demos.

## Adding a demo

On a new branch,

- Create a new folder at the root, with its name indicating the demo that is being added, lowercased and kebab-cased. (e.g. `shopping-room`)

- Upload source files for the demo. `index.html` file should always be at the root of the created directory.

- Create merge request.

## Notes

- After the merge, the demo can be added to rooom's [demo showcase website](https://demos.rooom.io/).
